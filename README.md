# FCC-Custom-Profile

Welcome to the Custom Campsite, a customizable version of the freeCodeCamp profile application!

Our client's mission is to provide its users with a curriculum where they can learn a specific skill set. Our application is analogous to their mission in that it provides campers with a highly customizable version of their freeCodeCamp profile by designing and building an app using the MVC paradigm and our server-side API.

Most of the sections are not fully complete yet but we currently have a general template for the profile page. We also have a Navbar with clickable elements. The clicking functionality is not working yet but we are hoping to add this feature in the near future so that the users can be directed to the corresponding page (Profile, Curriculum, Forum).

We are also hoping to implement some APIs. My team is still in the process of reviewing documentation.

We are also reviewing how we are going to add the customization features for the profile pages.

We hope you enjoy our first stage of this project. We have learned so much from working on this application.My team and I have a much better understanding of the pre-production process and how important it is to plan before implementing code. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email us at julianpluas@gmail.com Have a great day!
